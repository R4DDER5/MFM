# Brief and Objectives 
## Project Brief
STRAP LINE TO BE DISCUSSED BE THE BEST IN AN EVER EVOLVING MARKET BLAH BLAH BLAH

### PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project involves the design and development of a new e-commerce platform Alive and Flourishing (ALIVE). There will be a sister site (LIFO) and mobile application (ALF) to be made in concurrent development. Therefore the e-commerce site needs to have seamless data integration between both ALF and the LIFO website. There will also be a requirement for data integration between external 3rd party systems.

The e-commerce site will seek to place itself in a highly expanding and competitive market of lifestyle, health and new technology (DNA). The site will offer the ability to purchase DNA test kits, lifestyle reports, live consultancy time with an expert and promote subscriptions to the mobile application. The core products are a range of DNA kits with either a home or professional option. The customer will receive a physical copy of any reports but will also be able to access these reports electronically.

The e-commerce site will require an SEO strategy and the implementation of analytic's so that campaign effect and performance can be monitored. The e-commerce site needs the ability to publish automatically to social media channels and established online market places. Marketplaces, analytics, and social media must be centralised to allow automatic functionality and also be simple to use with a requirement to enable multiple users to contribute depending on access level.

The e-commerce site needs the ability to easily promote new items and display current or special offers. The products will be displayed and cross sold across various pages within the site.

The e-commerce site needs to have the ability to accept user generated content such as testimonials, news/blogs, reviews or comments. Any user generated content needs to be moderated by a site administrator before being published.

The e-commerce site will have the functionality to choose live video consultation with an expert, this feature will also be promoted on any product sales with the ability to upgrade the purchase via the checkout process. There will be a gallery of experts to select and the appropriate live consultation time can be scheduled via a booking system. The customer will be able to access their booking schedule and live feed via their profile once logged in. Additionally once logged in via the profile the customer can make potential changes to the booking as well as cancellations depending on whether it falls within the appropriate time-scales. The customer and expert will also be emailed reminder(s) of any upcoming appointments in advance of the appointment time. 

The e-commerce site will require access to an external printer and distribution who will be providing printing, picking, packing and shipment of the physical product when orders have been received. 

The e-commerce site needs the ability to receive unique access codes contained in reports. The system will be able to automatically determine the customer and apply any relevant discount/promotion associated.

The scope and tasks required to complete this project will follow the time-lines outlined within in order to deliver the components at the associated times. A list of deliverables and assumptions is included herein.

#### High Level Technical Requirements    
  * Internal Reports
  * External Reports
  * Shipping & Distribution
  * Mobile Application (ALF)
  * Printers
  * Live Chat
 
  
##### Internal Reports

The LIFO site will be responsible for generating lifestyle reports. These reports would be available for access via the ALIVE site. The reports purchased via the ALIVE site will be branded accordingly. The contents of the report will need to provided to the ALIVE site in the most efficient method. The requirement will be that report document is generated dynamically and does not involve additional login procedures for any customer to access their personal reports. The reports will need to be managed via the administration area of the site. This will involve a notification when a report is ready to the admin and also the ability to easily publish the report to display for the customer, notifying them when the report is ready. 

STILL FOR DISCUSSION
Ideally the system will exchange report content via a data method such as an API. The report will contain a mixture of elements such as graphs, tables and pictures as well as text. Ideally the core fixed elements will be controlled via a template system. See Appendix
The internal system will provide the full data what is required to build the reports. The reports will be dynamically generated based on data from the LIFO site. This will involve full data integration

 </p>
  
##### External Reports 

The system needs to be developed in a way that can accommodate any external reports from multiple 3rd parties. There will be a need to provide functionality to allow ANY 3rd party to submit reports. This will heavily depend on the functionality of the 3rd party and how they provide the reports. We will develop a system that will minimise further development work to accommodate.  
The two scenarios are as follows:  
The 3rd Party provides us the physical report in their preferred format  
The 3rd party provides us access to some form of API that allows us to generate the reports

__Method 1:__ The 3rd party provides us with the physical report: There will be some structure to process that the 3rd party will be informed of, mainly the external provided will upload the document. Details of report provided will be discussed resolution, page layout, file size, delivery options. We create a simple system that notifies the 3rd party when a report is required, who the customer is and requirements and what date the expected sample/data is received or required. This will presumably be via email the 3rd party will receive all the details required via an email. Contained in the email body will be a link to submit the report when complete. This link will allow the 3rd party to upload the document. On upload the document will be encrypted, stored in appropriate place and be prepared for moderation. The relevant moderator will notified that the document is ready. The document will then be easily approved by the moderator. Once approved the customer will have access to the document and receive notification via email. The document may need to be processed accordingly to suit print requirements.

Thoughts for this solution is where the documents are stored. Content Delivery Network

__Method 2:__ The 3rd party will provide to some form of API or Gateway. The report will be dynamically generated created based on the process we will use for internal reports. The moderator will be notified, the moderator will have the ability to approve. Once approved the customer will have access to the document and receive notification via email.

Storage file types and delivery options need to be reviewed in detail.

 </p>

##### Shipping and Distribution  
Access to an externaly shipping and distribution service will be required. Current considerations is mywarehouse which offers an API connection. Documentation of the API can be found in the link below

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.orderfulfilment.co.uk/s/myWarehouse_api_v1_9_consolidated.pdf" style="font-size:1.1em;">myWarehouse API Documentation</a>
[Visit this page](#https://www.orderfulfilment.co.uk/s/myWarehouse_api_v1_9_consolidated.pdf)

##### Mobile Application ALF

There will be a need for synchronisation between both ALF and ALIVE. This will involve subscriptions, product sales, booking schedules, surveys and reports.

##### Printers  

Ideally the report printing will be handled externally with automated process managed internally or connected externally. Some considerations required by print operators

- Report resolution (3rd Party may be providing)
- Setting report in print template
- Additional print pages added to report (printers require total page count to be divided by 4 so blank pages need inserting accordingly)  
- Secure file transfer options
- Security & GDPR
- Print scheduling, accurate lead times to customer
- Estimated print numbers
- Timescales for go live - usually to incorporate practice print run and testing.

Short-term may require printing to be handled internally so any print management console needs to be robust to accommodate internal printing and different external print providers.

##### Live Chat

The system will have a live chat feature which will notify the end user when staff are online and offline. The live chat will have the ability for end user and staff to communicate directly. Chat logs will be recorded for any further investigation or requests.  


### PROJECT TASKS

__1. Determine System Framework__  
Decide which architecture will used and give future proof etc etc. The options that have been considered are self hosted e-commerce - magento, external hosted shopify. There is now further consideration on using a complete framework options are, codeignitor, NodeJS and Laravel.  
__2. Setup Working Environments__  
I would initially propose to have 3 working environments. This would involve a Development Environment (DEV), a Staging Environment (STAGE) and a Live Environment (LIVE). All this environments should have a repository for version control in place. All initial development would take place in the DEV environment, when ready the work would move to the STAGE environment for more rigorous and thorough testing. Once the testing is complete and we have had the sign off that testing is complete and satisfactory, it would then move to the LIVE environment. If any problems are encountered at any point, work would move back to the DEV environment and then once again moved to STAGE for testing. Nothing would move to LIVE until everyone is completely happy for this to proceed.  
__3. Core Functionality and Internal Integration__  
Design and develop the key aspects that will be used for the core functionality of the site. Install e-commerce framework. Link LIFO reports with appropriate branding.  
__4. Site Design and Content Entry__  
Once the site design is completed and signed off, content provided to us will be entered onto the site pages. This will include text and pictures for each page to be created with the initial setup, along with meta data.  
__5. Develop External Integration__   
External reports, distribution and shipping and Printing  
__6. Checkout Payment Integration__  
Multiple payment options will be setup including Paypal, GoCardless and others to be confirmed. The entire shop experience shall be fully tested from general browsing through to product selection, checkout purchase and delivery notification.  
__7. Browser and Compatibility Testing__  
The site will be tested to make sure it works with a wide selection of browsers and to ensure it does not break when viewed on mobile devices or tablets.  
__8. Data Collection__  
A data collection pop-up invitation to the general mailing list as well as auto cart abandonment detection, general marketing and surveys. contact email and forms will be set up and tested.  

## Deliverables and Components

### Deliverables
1. Build Core Functionality  
We will need to prioritise building the e-commerce and LIFO reporting as urgent. Other features need the ability to be switched on and off when required as the project progresses.
2. E-commerce site Design  
Following the design being sent by the designer, one round of editing will be allowed before digital sign off is required to move forward to building the site.
3. Report/Email/Marketing branding needs to be appropriate to ALIVE and its products/services
4. Ensure shipping and printing is working correctly  .
5. Draft version of site, once all relevant content for the site we have been provided and applicable feature built this will be loaded in and testing can begin. Digital sign off will be required before deploying to the Live Site.
6. Final version of site
Relevant training will be conducted on features of site. 
7. Report building process reviewed, appointment booking and live feeds developed. Further integration with internal and external systems.

### Components

Component 1 | E-commerce User Account and Profile(s)  
Accounts can be created by registration or created manually, further access to other features like user, group and product management will be determined by user access levels.

Component 2 | Site Backup & Security  
A hard backup copy of the files associated with the site will be delivered on completion to the client on a memory stick, as well as backed up to appropriate secure location(s). Where appropriate the most secure encryption methods will be used.
